#EmptyResearch's Blackjack!
Hello! This is my Blackjack program, created with C++. 

I wanted to create somethings simple, but addicting, so I chose Blackjack.

In this branch (source), you'll find a README with a C++ Source File (.cpp). If you want to simply download a .exe, then head over to the "exe" branch.

Enjoy!

(As of 07/20/16, 16:25, my Blackjack is fully functional! Hooray!)
